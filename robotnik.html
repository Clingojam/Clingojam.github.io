          <br><font size = 4 color = "white">Robotnik is the <b><i>HOPELESS</i></b> universe's version of Doctor Eggman. His boisterous personality and vast intellect help to fuel his many robotics endeavors. However, his mind can sometimes get caught up in the fine details; this usually ends up causing his projects to fail at some point. Don't assume he's incompetent for that reason, as he has shown himself to be more than capable of creating deadly machines designed for mass destruction.
          <br>
          <br>TL;DR: A mad scientist with a sense of humor. He's only intimidating when he's surrounded by his creations.
