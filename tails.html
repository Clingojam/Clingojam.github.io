          <br>
          <br><font size = 4 color = "white">"Tails" is the <b><i>HOPELESS</i></b> universe's rendition of Tails. He was created with the express purpose of monitoring the Sonic world, as well as operating on Hopeless when necessary; all while appearing to be the innocent and cunning sidekick that the games demand. The beige areas of fur on his body are supposed to be bleached to sell the illusion that he's the real Tails, but he refuses to do so in order to funnel more money towards his engineering and security tasks. He has the capacity to do many things, from erasing people's memories to impersonating other characters using cloaking technology. All of these feats are kept exceptionally well hidden thanks to his ties with the outside world, allowing him to pose as the Tails that the public knows.
          <br>
          <br>TL;DR: A cold and calculated inventor who carries out his duties with a pinch of personal grudges. Not to be trusted.
