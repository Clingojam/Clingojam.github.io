          <br>
          <br><font size = 4 color = "white">Hopeless is the <b><i>HOPELESS</i></b> universe's rendition of Sonic. His fraile, splotched appearance stems from the abuse and spontaneous "redesigns" he recieves, the intensity of which entirely hinge on the critical and commercial success of his latest games and media. Hopeless' mental state has been all but obliterated thanks to this rigorous routine of scrutiny and pain, his frayed strands of sanity set ablaze in a spectacle of helpless suffering. Basically, this is how Sonic would act if that whole "tortured for months" line from Forces had a noticeable effect on Sonic, albeit cranked up to 11 in this case.

          <br>TL;DR: This dude's outta whack.
