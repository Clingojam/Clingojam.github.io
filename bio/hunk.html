          <br><font size = 4 color = "white">Hunk is the <b><i>HOPELESS</i></b> universe's parallel to Knuckles. His gentle nature is overruled by his strong sense of justice, which welled within him after learning of his people's history. He is exceptionally good at intimidation, but his use of the third person in his speech leads some people to avoid taking him seriously. He has trouble picking up on certain social cues due to his extended isolation on Jade Lake's fallen island. 
          <br>
          <br>TL;DR: A well-meaning soul with a tough exterior, save for a couple soft spots.
