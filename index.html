          <br><font size = 4 color = white><b><i>Hopeless</i></b> is a parody of Sonic the Hedgehog creepypastas as a whole. It takes place on an alternate version of Earth where society reached utopian levels of technical prowess in the late '80s.
          <br> Specifically, the comic follows Hunk (the codename of Knuckles) and Robotnik as they discover the true nature of the world they live in, recovering Hopeless (a.k.a. Sonic) from his mysterious prison and taking on their creators in the process.
